What'd you say?
Woah, woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)
What'd you say?
Now baby, listen, baby, don't ya treat me this-a way
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
(Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood)
(You ain't got no money you just ain't no good)
Well, I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)
What'd you say?
Well (don't you come back no more)
Uh, what'd you say? (don't you come back no more)
I didn't understand it! (don't you come back no more)
You can't mean that! (don't you come back no more)
Oh, now baby, please! (don't you come back no more)
What you tryin' to do to me? (don't you come back no more)
Oh don't hurt me like that!

Cool song
