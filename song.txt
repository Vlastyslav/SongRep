What'd you say?
Woah, woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)
What'd you say?
Now baby, listen, baby, don't ya treat me this-a way
'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
(Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood)
(You ain't got no money you just ain't no good)
Well, I guess if you say so
I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)
